// The structure of a dataset will be as described below.
// (we're using a very restricted design for simplicity).

// NOTE: Your code should handle both Windows-formatted and Linux-formatted files
// (which, unfortunately, differ in how the end of line is represented).

// The class labels (we assume, for simplicity, that only TWO values are possible).
// Whether or not the person in question died on the Titanic
survived
died

// The number of features:
4

// The names of the features (attributes describing the person aboard the
// Titanic when it sank):
type passenger crew
accomodations regular luxury
age adult child
gender male female

// The number of examples (will read this many in; ok to have more in the file)
120

// The examples (we assume, for simplicity, that all features are BOOLEAN-VALUED)
//   First is the example's name, then its category, finally followed
//   by the values of all of its features (listed in the order of the
//   feature names above, will be separated by "whitespace"). 
//   The (boring) names are simply used to concisely identify the examples.
//   Your decision-tree learner should NOT use these names as a feature (what would happen if you did?).


// You may assume that the feature values specified above are the only feature values that will appear.  
// Ie, no need for error checking (but OK to do so).
